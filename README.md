# ðŸ”¥ Simple Python Firewall Simulator

This is a basic firewall simulation tool written in Python as part of my learning process. It randomly generates IP addresses and checks them against a static list of firewall rules to decide whether to allow or block traffic.

---

## ðŸ’¡ What It Does

- Randomly generates IPs in the `192.168.1.0/24` range
- Checks if each IP is in the "blocked" list
- Outputs a simulated action (`block` or `allow`) along with a random event number

## ðŸ§  Why I Built This

I followed a YouTube tutorial to understand how basic firewall logic can be simulated using Python. I now understand how condition-based filtering works with IPs, and how to use dictionaries and functions in Python.

## ðŸš€ Run the Script

```bash
python3 firewall_sim.py
